# repototxt

## Overview
This Python script provides an automated way to document the structure and contents of a software repository. It generates a comprehensive text file that includes both a hierarchical tree of the directory structure and detailed contents of each file. This tool is particularly useful for understanding and analyzing the structure of codebases and can be invaluable for training AI models like GPT and other custom LLMs on specific code repositories.

## Features
- **Directory/File Tree**: Outputs a high-level overview of the repository's directory and file structure.
- **Detailed Contents**: Provides the full content of each file, offering insights into the code or text within the repository.
- **Customizable Ignoring Mechanism**: Flexibility to specify file types, individual files, and directories to ignore (e.g., binary files, temporary files, or specific directories like `node_modules`).
- **Repository Name Inclusion**: Automatically includes the repository's name in the documentation for easy identification.
- **Command-Line Flexibility**: Tailor the script's functionality at runtime using various command-line arguments.

## Usage
1. **Clone the Repository**: First, clone the GitHub repository you want to document to your local machine.

2. **Set Up the Script**: Place the script in a directory of your choice.

3. **Run the Script**: Use the following command to run the script:
   ```bash
   python repo_to_text.py [path_to_repo] [output_file_name.txt]
   ```
   Replace `[path_to_repo]` with the path to your cloned repository and `[output_file_name.txt]` with your desired output file name.

   Optional command-line arguments:
   - `--ignore-files`: List of file names to ignore.
   - `--ignore-types`: List of file extensions to ignore.
   - `--exclude-dir`: List of directory names to exclude.
   - `--ignore-settings`: Flag to ignore common settings files.
   - `--include-dir`: Specific directory to include.

4. **Review the Output**: The script will create an `output.txt` file (or your specified file name) with the repository's structure and file contents.

## Application in Training GPTS/LLM (what I use it and created it for)
- **Data Structuring for AI Understanding**: The script's output can be used to train AI models like GPT on the structure and content of software repositories. This is particularly useful for models being trained to understand code and documentation.
- **Custom Dataset Creation**: By using this script on multiple repositories, you can create a custom dataset tailored for specific programming languages, frameworks, or coding styles.
- **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: The detailed documentation assists AI models in gaining a better contextual understanding of how real-world codebases are structured and maintained.
